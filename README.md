# Analyzing-Loan-Application-Data-using-Python


# Problem Statement
A “Consumer Finance Company” specialize in lending loans to customers. They are interested in understanding the patterns in the
clients who has difficulty in paying installments. These features can help in identifying such loans applications and can lead
to denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (at a higher interest rate) and, thereby improving there portfolio and risk  assessment .


# Analysis Design
The analysis is broadly divided into three steps
1. Exploratory analysis to understand the data set, clean the data set, and identify key column for the analysis
2. Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis for target categorical and numerical variables
3. Identifying the variables which can help in predicting high risk customers 

# Some important variables which we consider from domain are as below
1. TARGET: Customers who have delayed at least one payment, will be a primary variable in relation to which other variable are analysed.
2. NAME_CONTRACT_STATUS: Status of previous loan applications, will serve as an important variable for analysis.


# Assumption
We do not know how many payments a customer missed. All the customers, with at least one missed payment, will be treated  equally.
